# Design-of-algorithms-for-a-mobile-crawling-robot
The objective of the paper is to achieve both theoretical and practical implementation of a crawling robot, mimicking the locomotion of snakes or worms. This unique motion capability proves highly advantageous for navigating challenging terrains or confined spaces where conventional robots face limitations.
